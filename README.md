This section focuses on the Stack data structure, a fundamental concept in Java that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle.

Definition and Characteristics: Explained Stack as a collection of elements where the last element added is the first one to be removed, making it ideal for scenarios requiring reversal or backtracking.

Basic Operations: Demonstrated key operations such as push (adding an element), pop (removing the top element), and peek (viewing the top element without removing it).

Implementation: Provided an example of stack implementation using both arrays and linked lists, highlighting the differences in memory usage and performance.

Common Use Cases: Illustrated practical applications of stacks, such as expression evaluation (e.g., postfix notation), function call management (call stack), and backtracking algorithms (e.g., maze solving).

Advantages and Limitations: Discussed the advantages of using stacks for managing temporary data and control flow, as well as limitations like fixed capacity in array-based implementations.
